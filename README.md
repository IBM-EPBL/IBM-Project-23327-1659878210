Skill / Job Recommender Application

# ABSTRACT:
To develop an end-to-end web application capable of displaying the current job openings based on the user skillset. The user and their information are stored in Database. An alert is sent when there is an opening based on the user skillset. Users will interact with a chatbot and can get the recommendations based on their skills. We can use a job search API to get the current job openings in the market which will fetch the data directly from the webpage
